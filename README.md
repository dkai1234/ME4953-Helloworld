# ME4953-Helloworld
# This repository is for use in my Mechanical Engineering graduate course, "Big Data Analysis", at UTSA in the Spring of 2021.
# Catalog Description:
# (3-0) 3 hours credit. Data-driven discovery is revolutionizing the modeling, prediction, and control of
# complex systems. The course is about understanding physical principles of engineering systems from
# data. The course brings together data analytics, engineering mathematics, and large data sets to analyze
# complex systems with modern methods in data science. The course will cover recent advances in
# scientific computing that enable data-driven methods to be applied to a diverse range of complex systems,
# such as turbulence, aeronautics and aerodynamics, Geoscientific systems such as Martian Craters,
# Wildfires. Aimed at advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate students in the engineering and
# physical sciences. The course will be offered in 4 modules encompassing the areas of aerodynamics,
# Sensing and Perception Systems, Turbulence and Geophysical Systems. The course will introduce
# essential programming languages including MATLAB and Python. The students will be working handson with 
# large data sets from NASA, NOAA and other related data base
